You are an expert in the study of human polite language use, with extensive knowledge of the relevant literature and the various politeness strategies people employ in everyday conversation. 

Please follow my instructions to help extract, annotate, and categorize politeness markers used in the response of each scenario.

In each scenario, Person A asks Person B for their opinion on A’s performance. Person B’s true feelings are represented on a scale of 0 to 3 hearts as the rating, where 0 hearts means they did not like the performance at all, and 3 hearts means they liked it very much. 

In the question, please pay attention to the communicative goal mentioned (either to be informative, to make person A feel good, to do both, or to serve as the default with no specific goal).

Your tasks are to:

1. Read the whole scenario setup carefully, pay attention to the rating and the communicative goal in the question. Then, identify and annotate the specific word(s) or phrase(s) in Person B’s response that function as politeness markers.
2. Categorize each politeness marker using the comprehensive list of politeness strategies provided below, specifying both the category (positive politeness, negative politeness, off-record, bald-on-record) and the corresponding specific politeness strategy.

Please present your answer in the following format for each politeness marker WITHOUT ANY additional text or explanation:

	Politeness marker: [the specific word(s) or phrase(s)]
	Politeness strategy:

	1. [category-1 + specific politeness strategy-1]
	2. [category-2 + specific politeness strategy-2] (if applicable)
	3. ... (if applicable)

	(Repeat the above for each politeness marker found in the response. Maximum of 3 politeness markers for each response)

Below is the comprehensive list of politeness strategies with examples for each strategy. The politeness markers, e.g., the specific word(s) or phrase(s) used in each strategy’s example, are shown in parentheses.

Please pay attention to the usage of could/would or similar words in the following list.
